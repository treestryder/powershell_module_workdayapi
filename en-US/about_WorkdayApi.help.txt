# Workday SOAP API Powershell Script Module #


## Description ##
Provides simple methods for accessing the Workday SOAP API.

This simple Powershell Module has been written to fulfill my employer's Workday automation needs. I see this as a prototype, while I experiment with the best way to expose the complexities of the Workday API in a Powershell-y way. Thinking that the community might find it helpful and may even wish to comment or contribute, I have hosted the source on Bitbucket (https://bitbucket.org/treestryder/powershell_module_workdayapi/).


## Features ##

* Easy command-line use, after setting default configuration options and securely saving them to the current user's profile.
* Get Worker information for one or all workers.
* Get / Set / Update Worker email.
* Get / Set / Update Worker phone.
* Upload Worker Photos.
* Upload Worker Documents.
* Run reports.
* Trigger Integrations and retreive their status.
* Submit arbitrary API calls.
* A sample script to push A.D. changes to Workday (samples/Push_AD_to_Workday.ps1).
